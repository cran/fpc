Description: Fuzzy and crisp fixed point cluster analysis based on
        Mahalanobis distance and linear regression fixed point
        clusters. Semi-explorative, semi-model-based clustering
        methods, operating on n*p data, do not need prespecification of
        number of clusters, produce overlapping clusters. Symmetric and
        asymmetric discriminant projections separate groups optimally,
        used to visualize the separation of groupings, visual cluster
        validation. Clusterwise linear regression by normal mixture
        modeling. Cluster validation statistics for distance based
        clustering including corrected Rand index. Clusterwise cluster
        stability assessment. DBSCAN clustering. Interface functions
        for many clustering methods implemented in R. Note that the use
        of the package mclust (called by function prabclust) is
        protected by a special license, see
        http://www.stat.washington.edu/mclust/license.txt, particularly
        point 6.
