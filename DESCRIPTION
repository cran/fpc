Description: Various methods for clustering and cluster validation.
        Fixed point clustering. Linear regression clustering.
        Clustering by merging Gaussian mixture components. Symmetric
        and asymmetric discriminant projections for visualisation of
        the separation of groupings. Cluster validation statistics for
        distance based clustering including corrected Rand index.
        Clusterwise cluster stability assessment. Methods for
        estimation of the number of clusters: Calinski-Harabasz,
        Tibshirani and Walther's prediction strength.
        Gaussian/multinomial mixture fitting for mixed
        continuous/categorical variables. Veriablewise statistics for
        cluster interpretation. DBSCAN clustering. Interface functions
        for many clustering methods implemented in R, including
        estimating the number of clusters with kmeans, pam and clara.
        Modality diagnosis for Gaussian mixtures. Note that the use of
        the package mclust (called by function prabclust) is protected
        by a special license, see
