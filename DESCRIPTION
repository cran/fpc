Description: Various methods for clustering and cluster validation.
        Fixed point clustering. Linear regression clustering.
        Clustering by merging Gaussian mixture components. Symmetric
        and asymmetric discriminant projections for visualisation of
        the separation of groupings. Cluster validation statistics for
        distance based clustering including corrected Rand index.
        Cluster-wise cluster stability assessment. Methods for
        estimation of the number of clusters: Calinski-Harabasz,
        Tibshirani and Walther's prediction strength, Fang and Wang's
        bootstrap stability.  Gaussian/multinomial mixture fitting for
        mixed continuous/categorical variables. Variable-wise
        statistics for cluster interpretation. DBSCAN clustering.
        Interface functions for many clustering methods implemented in
        R, including estimating the number of clusters with kmeans, pam
        and clara. Modality diagnosis for Gaussian mixtures. For an
        overview see package?fpc.
