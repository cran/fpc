\title{Cluster validation statistics}
\description{
  Computes a number of distance based statistics, which can be used for cluster
  validation, comparison between clusterings and decision about
  the number of clusters: cluster sizes, cluster diameters,
  average distances within and between clusters, cluster separation,
  biggest within cluster gap, 
  average silhouette widths, the Calinski and Harabasz index,
  a Pearson version of
  Hubert's gamma coefficient, the Dunn index and two indexes
  to assess the similarity of two clusterings, namely the corrected Rand
  index and Meila's VI.
}
\usage{
cluster.stats(d = NULL, clustering, alt.clustering = NULL,
                           noisecluster=FALSE,
                              silhouette = TRUE, G2 = FALSE, G3 = FALSE,
                              wgap=TRUE, sepindex=TRUE, sepprob=0.1,
                              sepwithnoise=TRUE,
                              compareonly = FALSE,
                              aggregateonly = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{d}{a distance object (as generated by \code{dist}) or a distance
    matrix between cases.}
  \item{clustering}{an integer vector of length of the number of cases,
    which indicates a clustering. The clusters have to be numbered
    from 1 to the number of clusters.}
  \item{alt.clustering}{an integer vector such as for
    \code{clustering}, indicating an alternative clustering. If provided, the
    corrected Rand index and Meila's VI for \code{clustering}
    vs. \code{alt.clustering} are computed.}
  \item{noisecluster}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, it is assumed that the
    largest cluster number in \code{clustering} denotes a 'noise
    class', i.e. points that do not belong to any cluster. These points
    are not taken into account for the computation of all functions of
    within and between cluster distances including the validation
    indexes.} 
  \item{silhouette}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the silhouette statistics
    are computed, which requires package \code{cluster}.}
  \item{G2}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, Goodman and Kruskal's index G2
    (cf. Gordon (1999), p. 62) is computed. This executes lots of
    sorting algorithms and can be very slow (it has been improved
    by R. Francois - thanks!)}
  \item{G3}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the index G3
    (cf. Gordon (1999), p. 62) is computed. This executes \code{sort}
    on all distances and can be extremely slow.}
  \item{wgap}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the widest within-cluster gaps
    (largest link in within-cluster minimum spanning tree) are
    computed. This is used for finding a good number of clusters in
    Hennig (2013).}
  \item{sepindex}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, a separation index is
    computed, defined based on the distances for every point to the
    closest point not in the same cluster. The separation index is then
    the mean of the smallest proportion \code{sepprob} of these. This
    allows to formalise separation less sensitive to a single or a few
    ambiguous points. The output component corresponding to this is
    \code{sindex}, not \code{separation}! This is used for finding a
    good number of clusters in Hennig (2013).
  }
  \item{sepprob}{numerical between 0 and 1, see \code{sepindex}.}
  \item{sepwithnoise}{logical. If \code{TRUE} and \code{sepindex} and
    \code{noisecluster} are both \code{TRUE}, the noise points are
    incorporated as cluster in the separation index (\code{sepindex})
    computation. Also
    they are taken into account for the computation for the minimum
    cluster separation.} 
  \item{compareonly}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, only the corrected Rand index
    and Meila's VI are
    computed and given out (this requires \code{alt.clustering} to be
    specified).}
  \item{aggregateonly}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (and not
    \code{compareonly}), no clusterwise but only aggregated information
    is given out (this cuts the size of the output down a bit).}

}

\note{
  Because \code{cluster.stats} processes a full dissimilarity matrix, it
  isn't suitable for large data sets. You may consider
  \code{\link{distcritmulti}} in that case.
