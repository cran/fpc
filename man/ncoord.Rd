\title{Neighborhood based discriminant coordinates}
\description{
  Neighborhood based discriminant coordinates as defined in Hastie and
  Tibshirani (1996) and a robustified version as defined in Hennig (2003).
  The principle is to maximize the projection of a between
  classes covariance matrix, which is defined by averaging the
  between classes covariance matrices in the neighborhoods of all points.

\usage{
ncoord(xd, clvecd, nn=50, weighted=FALSE,
                    sphere="mcd", orderall=TRUE, countmode=1000, ...)
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{xd}{the data matrix; a numerical object which can be coerced
    to a matrix.}
  \item{clvecd}{integer vector of class numbers; length must equal
    \code{nrow(xd)}.}
  \item{nn}{integer. Number of points which belong to the neighborhood
    of each point (including the point itself).}
  \item{weighted}{logical. \code{FALSE} corresponds to the original
    method of Hastie and Tibshirani (1996). If \code{TRUE},
    the between classes
    covariance matrices B are weighted by w/trace B, where w is some
    weight depending on the sizes of the
    classes in the neighborhood. Division by trace B reduces the effect
    of outliers. \code{TRUE} cooresponds to WNC as defined in Hennig
    (2003).}
  \item{sphere}{a covariance matrix or one of
    "mve", "mcd", "classical", "none". The matrix used for sphering the
    data. "mcd" and "mve" are robust covariance matrices as implemented
    in \code{\link{cov.rob}}. "classical" refers to the classical
    covariance matrix. "none" means no sphering and use of the raw
    data.}
  \item{orderall}{logical. By default, the neighborhoods are computed by
    ordering all points each time. If \code{FALSE}, the neighborhoods
    are computed by selecting \code{nn} times the nearest point from the
    remaining points, which may be faster sometimes.}
  \item{countmode}{optional positive integer. Every \code{countmode}
    algorithm runs \code{ncoord} shows a message.}
  \item{...}{no effect}
}
% \details{
% }
\value{
  List with the following components
  \item{ev}{eigenvalues in descending order.}
  \item{units}{columns are coordinates of projection basis vectors.
  New points \code{x} can be projected onto the projection basis vectors
  by \code{x \%*\% units}}
  \item{proj}{projections of \code{xd} onto \code{units}.}
