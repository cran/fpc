\title{Misclassification probabilities in mixtures}
\description{
   Estimates a misclassification probability in a mixture distribution
   between two mixture components from estimated posterior probabilities
   regardless of component parameters, see Hennig (2010).
}
\usage{
confusion(z,pro,i,j,adjustprobs=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{z}{matrix of posterior probabilities for observations (rows) to
    belong to mixture components (columns), so entries need to sum up to
    1 for each row.}
  \item{pro}{vector of component proportions, need to sum up to 1.}
  \item{i}{integer. Component number.}
  \item{j}{integer. Component number.}
  \item{adjustprobs}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, probabilities are
    initially standardised so that those for components \code{i} and
    \code{j} add up to one (i.e., if they were the only components).}
}

\value{
  Estimated probability that an observation generated by component
  \code{j} is classified to component \code{i} by maximum a posteriori rule.
